# HR GraphQL Server

This is the graphql server for the api endpoint for the horse racing game side project that I am working on. 
It's implemented in golang and the graphql implementation is done through the library gqlgen.

Here is the [live demo](https://vntchang.dev/hrgraphql/).
Currently you can only query horses based on the internal id that I used for my database so there's really nothing that you can use. I use graphql as my api endpoint mainly because I need the pedigree of horses and I need some flexibility that's why I opted for a graphql server.
